# Homework-Week-01

The tasks I completed for this assignment were:
    - Updated the old HTML4 semantics to current day standards with HTML5
        (examples: from <div> to <header>/<section>/<aside>/<footer>)
    - Added alt attributes to the images / icons that describe them as placeholder if the images don't load
    - Fixed the button for "Search-Engine-Optimization", it was missing the "id="Search-Engine-Optimization" from its code, once added it fixed it and works perfectly now!
    - Both the HTML and the READ.ME are uploaded and deplyoed to get hub.
